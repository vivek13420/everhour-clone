                  When you sign up, you get a fully-functional account for 2
                  weeks, which gives you access to everything Everhour has to
                  offer. After 14 days, you will need to pick a plan and enter
                  your credit card details. We’ll email you a couple of days
                  before your trial expires to remind you.

                  This is kind of a basic usage fee. You can subscribe even if
                  you have fewer users, however, in this case, the minimum usage
                  fee will apply. Lite plan starts at $10 and includes 2 users.
                  Team plan starts at $42.5 and includes 5 users.

                  Yes, you can upgrade your plan at any time. You will be
                  credited for the remainder of your current plan and charged
                  for your new plan when you upgrade.

                  Absolutely! Everhour is pay-as-you-go, and you can easily add
                  or remove members from your account with a couple of clicks.

                  No problem. If you decide Everhour isn’t for you (or you just
                  need to pause), simply cancel before your next billing period.
                  This date is listed on your billing page. Unfortunately, we
                  can’t refund you for partial use or the amount of time left in
                  your subscription. Also, after cancelling, you can no longer
                  subscribe to the legacy plans, only plans currently listed on
                  our Pricing page.
